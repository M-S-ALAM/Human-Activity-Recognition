# Human-Activity-Recognition
Machine Learning/Deep Learning

<br> The goal of this project is to create a model that can predict human actions like walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and lying down.

This dataset was gathered from 30 people (referred to as subjects in this dataset) who were doing various activities while carrying a smartphone around their waists. The data is collected using the smartphone's sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope). This experiment was videotaped so that the data could be manually labelled.</br>

## How data was recorded

They acquired '3-axial linear acceleration' (_tAcc-XYZ_) from the accelerometer and '3-axial angular velocity' (_tGyro-XYZ_) from the Gyroscope with many modifications utilising the sensors (Gyroscope and accelerometer) in a smartphone.
> prefix 't' in those metrics denotes time.

> suffix 'XYZ' represents 3-axial signals in X , Y, and Z directions.

### Feature names


1. These sensor signals are preprocessed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width windows(sliding windows) of 2.56 seconds each with 50% overlap. ie., each window has 128 readings. 

2. From Each window, a feature vector was obtianed by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
> In our dataset, each datapoint represents a window with different readings 
3. The accelertion signal was saperated into Body and Gravity acceleration signals(___tBodyAcc-XYZ___ and ___tGravityAcc-XYZ___) using some low pass filter with corner frequecy of 0.3Hz.

4. After that, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtian _jerk signals_ (___tBodyAccJerk-XYZ___ and ___tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ___). 

5. The magnitude of these 3-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidian norm. This magnitudes are represented as features with names like _tBodyAccMag_, _tGravityAccMag_, _tBodyAccJerkMag_, _tBodyGyroMag_ and _tBodyGyroJerkMag_.

6. Finally, We've got frequency domain signals from some of the available signals by applying a FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). These signals obtained were labeled with ___prefix 'f'___ just like original signals with ___prefix 't'___. These signals are labeled as ___fBodyAcc-XYZ___, ___fBodyGyroMag___ etc.,.

9. We can obtain some other vectors by taking the average of signals in a single window sample. These are used on the angle() variable'
